Some old Bridge-related stuff.

lic2 is my 2001 Licentiate thesis "Reinforcement Learning Systems
A Study using Bidding in the Game of Bridge"; spend 2 years but the results was not so exciting - nowadays (2020) there are much better methods and hardware so would be nice to redo it in a better way when time permits.

calif4 is an article presented at Stanford about Bridge and Q-learning

givar6 is a dealing program (partly in Swedish) made for bidding practice, you can select hand with alternative specs and also spread strength a bit from the true distribution. A lot of stuff is for the printout incl opponents disturbances

gil is a Swedish article about GIB in our Bridge magazine

dtkl is an example/start of how human&computer (semi)readable bidding system definition might look like
